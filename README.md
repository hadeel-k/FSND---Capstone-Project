# Casting Agency Project

## About The Project

The Casting Agency project details exactly how the API should be structured: models, attributes, endpoints, roles, permissions, and tests. 

It models a company that is responsible for creating movies and managing and assigning actors to those movies. You are an Executive Producer within the company and are creating a system to simplify and streamline your process.

### Models:
Movies with attributes title and release date
Actors with attributes name, age and gender

### Endpoints:
GET /actors and /movies
DELETE /actors/ and /movies/
POST /actors and /movies and
PATCH /actors/ and /movies/

### Roles:
##### Casting Assistant
Can view actors and movies
##### Casting Director
All permissions a Casting Assistant has and…
Add or delete an actor from the database
Modify actors or movies
##### Executive Producer
All permissions a Casting Director has and…
Add or delete a movie from the database

### Tests:
One test for success behavior of each endpoint
One test for error behavior of each endpoint
At least two tests of RBAC for each role

## Required Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

#### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are libraries to handle the lightweight sqlite database. Since we want you to focus on auth, we handle the heavy lift for you in `./src/database/models.py`. We recommend skimming this code first so you know how to interface with the Drink model.

## Running the server locally

From within the `./src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

Each time you open a new terminal session, run:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py;
export FLASK_ENV=development;
```

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.
